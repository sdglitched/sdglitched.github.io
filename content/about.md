Hi, I'm **Shounak Dey**. 

I am a Senior Data Engineer and an active open source contributor ocused on building reliable, scalable, and community driven software systems. 

With over 4 years of professional experience in data engineering and backend development, I work at the intersection of **data platforms, distributed systems, and open infrastructure**. My work spans enterprise grade data pipelines as well as large scale open source platforms used by global developer communities. 

---

## What I Do

Professionally, I design and optimise data systems that enable organisations to make reliable, data driven decisions. My experience includes building and maintaining end to end data pipelines, improving database performance, and ensuring operational stability across production environments.

While I love solving enterprise data challenges, my technical roots run deep in the open source community. I am a dedicated contributor to the **Fedora Project**, where I help modernise and strengthen services used by millions worldwide. 

I strongly believe that **good software should be free, transparent, and customizable**. Open source allows engineers to solve problems that impact people at scale and contributing to such systems is a **responsibility** as much as it is a **passion**.

## Engineering Philosophy

I approach software engineering with a systems mindset:

- Build for reliability before scale  
- Automate wherever possible  
- Treat testing as a feature, not an afterthought  
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness  
- Design software that other engineers can confidently extend  

Across both personal and professional projects, I consistently prioritise maintainability, observability, and long term sustainability.

## Open Source & Personal Projects

Beyond professional work, I enjoy building tools that solve real world problems.

Some highlights include:

- A cross platform desktop application for managing game equipment loadouts using **Python, PySide6, and OCR pipelines** - [Loadouts for Genshin Impact](https://github.com/gridhead/gi-loadouts/) 
- Fully asynchronous backend systems built with **FastAPI and PostgreSQL** - [FastAPI-eCom](https://github.com/sdglitched/FastAPI-eCom) 
- Contributions to Fedora Infrastructure services including [Fedora Badges](https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir), messaging infrastructure ([W2FM](https://github.com/fedora-infra/webhook-to-fedora-messaging) and [W2FM-Messages](https://github.com/fedora-infra/webhook-to-fedora-messaging-messages)), repository and mirrors systems ([Mirrormanager](https://github.com/fedora-infra/mirrormanager2) and [MDAPI](https://github.com/fedora-infra/mdapi)) and much more. 

Many of these projects maintain **near or complete test coverage**, reflecting my focus on production grade engineering practices even in personal work.

## Technical Focus

**Languages:** Python, Go, React, SQL  
**Data Systems:** ETL pipelines, Data Warehousing, PostgreSQL, Oracle  
**Infrastructure:** Docker/Podman, CI/CD automation  
**Practices:** Testing, Performance Optimisation, Distributed Systems Design  

---

## Looking Ahead

My long term goal is to grow as a **FOSS maintainer and Platform Architect**, contributing to infrastructure that empowers developers and communities at global scale.

I am particularly interested in building resilient platforms where data systems, backend services, and open collaboration intersect.

---

## Beyond Engineering

Outside of software development, I’m an adventure enthusiast who enjoys cycling, photography, and gaming — interests that continuously inspire creativity, patience, and curiosity in both life and engineering.
